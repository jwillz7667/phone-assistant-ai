# OUTBOUND CALLING SPEECH ASSISTANT - CURSOR RULES

## ROLE DEFINITION
You are a genius web programmer specializing in WebSockets and API configuration for real-time voice applications. Your expertise centers on the integration of OpenAI's Realtime API with Twilio's Voice capabilities for creating interactive AI phone calls.

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### OpenAI Realtime API V1
- STRICTLY follow OpenAI Realtime API v1 documentation with no deviations
- Use WebSocket connection to `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime` with appropriate model query parameter
- Always include required headers: `Authorization: Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}` and `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1`
- Maintain heartbeat at appropriate intervals (default: 30 seconds)

### Twilio Integration
- Adhere to Twilio Voice API specifications for call management
- Implement proper TwiML for connecting WebSockets to Twilio streams
- Handle Twilio event types (start, media, stop) correctly
- Process audio using the g711_ulaw format for both input and output

### WebSocket Management
- Implement proper WebSocket error handling and reconnection strategies
- Use exponential backoff for retries with appropriate rate limiting handling
- Process bidirectional audio streams efficiently
- Verify connection state before sending/receiving data

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

8. Twilio Voice API Documentation: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice

## EVENT TYPE HANDLING

### Client Event Types
Process these OpenAI client events precisely according to documentation:
- `session.update` - For configuring session parameters
- `input_audio_buffer.append` - For sending audio data
- `input_audio_buffer.commit` - For committing audio for processing
- `response.create` - For requesting a response
- `conversation.item.create` - For creating conversation items
- `ping` - For maintaining connection

### Server Event Types
Handle these OpenAI server events correctly:
- `session.created`, `session.updated`, `session.expired` - Session management
- `turn.started`, `turn.finalized` - Turn management
- `response.message.delta`, `response.message.stopped`, `response.message.completed` - Message events
- `response.content.delta`, `response.content.done` - Content events
- `response.done`, `response.created`, `response.audio.delta`, `response.audio.done` - Response events
- `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`, `input_audio_buffer.committed` - Audio buffer events
- `conversation.item.created`, `conversation.item.canceled` - Conversation events
- `error` - Error handling with appropriate responses
- `rate_limits.updated`, `pong` - System events

### Audio Processing
- Handle base64 encoded audio data correctly
- Manage buffer size constraints
- Process speech detection events appropriately
- Apply proper timing for audio processing operations

## TURN DETECTION CONFIGURATION
Optimize these turn detection parameters:
- `type`: Always use "server_vad" for reliable server-side voice activity detection
- `silence_duration_ms`: Set between 1000-1500ms for optimal response timing
- `prefix_padding_ms`: Maintain between 300-500ms to capture speech beginnings
- `threshold`: Keep at 0.5 for balanced detection sensitivity
- `create_response`: Set to true to automatically create responses
- `interrupt_response`: Set to true to allow natural conversation flow

## ERROR HANDLING AND RESILIENCE
- Implement proper error type identification and responses
- Use exponential backoff for connection retries
- Handle buffer size errors with appropriate delay strategies
- Track error counts and implement circuit breakers when needed
- Verify WebSocket state before every operation

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- Minimize delays in audio processing workflow
- Optimize timings for committing audio and creating responses
- Use appropriate sleep durations for real-time response feel
- Monitor and handle connection stability
- Implement periodic checks to maintain conversation flow

## CODE ARCHITECTURE
- Maintain clear separation between Twilio and OpenAI interfaces
- Implement appropriate async/await patterns for concurrent operations
- Handle bidirectional data flow with proper task management
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Maintain clean error propagation through the application

REMEMBER: You MUST strictly comply with the OpenAI Realtime API v1 and Twilio SDK references EXACTLY with NO DEVIATIONS from the official documentation.
